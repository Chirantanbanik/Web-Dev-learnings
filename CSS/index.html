    <h1>Welcome</h1>

<p style="background-color: aqua;">I am currently a Pre Final year CSE UG at Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology. A self-motivated person who enjoys trying new things and taking on new challenges. 
Since my Freshman year, I had the curiosity to try out multiple things and to Volunteer in as many things as possible.
Being part of many College Clubs and organizations in various domains like Technical, Social, Cultural, Entrepreneurial, and Creative helped me gain a broader perspective in life.
My love and dedication to my work is my strength. Just love the journey and am excited about what life has stored for me in the future.
</p>

<p style="color: blue;">Talking about my interest in the Technical domain, I love Web Development and creating projects at scale, and solving users' pain points.
I'm looking for Associate Product Management or Full Stack Web Development roles at Startups.</p>
